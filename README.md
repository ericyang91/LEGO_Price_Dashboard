![LEGO DASHBOARD](https://github.com/ericyang91/LEGO_the_Ultimate_Dashboard/blob/main/lego_dashboard_snippet.png)

## Purpose
This data analytics project explores the evolution of prices and the number of bricks in LEGO sets across various theme groups. The analysis begins with raw dataset processing using Python's Pandas library for efficient data cleaning and preparation. The clean dataset is then exported to Tableau Public, where a dynamic and interactive dashboard is crafted.

## Key Features:

`Data Cleaning with Pandas:` Leveraging the power of Python, the project ensures a robust dataset, free from inconsistencies and errors.

`Visualization in Tableau:` The cleaned data is seamlessly integrated into Tableau Public, allowing for intuitive exploration and insightful analysis.

`Dynamic Dashboard:` The Tableau dashboard offers an engaging interface to visualize the trends, relationships, and patterns in LEGO set prices and brick counts over time.

`Theme Group Insights:` Explore the distinctive characteristics of LEGO sets based on theme groups, providing valuable insights for enthusiasts and collectors.

## How to Use:

`Dataset:` Find the raw dataset in the Resource directory.

`Data Cleaning:` Refer to the Jupyter Notebook in the directory for the Pandas-based data cleaning process.

`Tableau Dashboard:` Access the [Tableau Public link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ji.yeol.yang/viz/LEGOPriceDashboard/Dashboard) provided to interact with the dynamic dashboard and uncover fascinating trends in LEGO sets.


Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or extend the analysis to uncover even more insights from the world of LEGO sets!
